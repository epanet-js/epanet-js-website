              <AccordionContent>
                epanet-js is a modern, web-based water network modeling tool
                based on the EPANET engine. It allows you to build, simulate,
                and analyze water distribution networks directly in your browser
                without installing any software.

              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Yes! epanet-js uses a local-first approach, meaning your project
                data is saved directly to your computer, not to our servers.
                This ensures your sensitive network data remains private and
                under your control.{" "}

              <AccordionContent>
                No, you can start using epanet-js immediately without creating
                an account or logging in. Simply visit our website and launch
                the application to begin modeling.

              </AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Yes, epanet-js supports importing .inp files from desktop
                EPANET. You can seamlessly transition your existing projects to
                our web-based platform.

              <AccordionTrigger>Does epanet-js work on Mac?</AccordionTrigger>
              <AccordionContent>
                Yes! epanet-js works on all modern browsers including Chrome,
                Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Since it runs in a web browser,
                epanet-js works great on macOS, Windows, and Linux. This makes
                it a great option if you've had trouble installing traditional
                EPANET on a Mac. For the best experience, we recommend using the
                latest version of your preferred browser.

              <AccordionContent>
                Yes, our source code is public from day one, but there’s a
                two-year delay from the time we release a new version to when it
                becomes fully open source. This is how we drive sustainable
                open-source development for epanet-js, and, by extension,
                EPANET. You can{" "}
