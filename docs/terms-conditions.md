## 2. Acceptance

_When you accept the Terms._

Accessing, using, and/or subscribing to the services available on this Website grants you the status of User.

By accessing or using the Website or Service, you expressly agree to be bound by these Terms and any updates thereto.

## 3. Service description

_What our tool offers you._

epanet-js is a tool for the design and simulation of hydraulic networks. Our service is designed for efficiency and privacy, allowing users to:

- Draw networks visually: Easily add nodes, pipes, and reservoirs, with auto-joining and auto-elevation features to streamline your work.
- Build from GIS data: Take your existing geospatial data and automatically create an interconnected hydraulic model.
- Run simulations instantly: Get results from your models quickly and efficiently.
- Visualize clear results: Review pressures, flows, and velocities at a glance, presented with an intuitive color code.
- Work on satellite maps: Overlay your networks on real-world designs using background and satellite maps.
- Full compatibility with EPANET: Import and export .inp files directly, with no conversions needed.
- Cross-platform, no installation required: Access epanet-js from any modern browser on Mac, Linux, or Windows, with no installations or virtual machines.

Our main focus is “local-first”:

- No installation required.
- No account required for basic use.
- No mandatory cloud storage.

By default, all your projects and simulations run and are stored locally on your computer, ensuring you total control, security, and privacy. Cloud storage is optional and is only activated if the User chooses to use it.

## 4. Platform use

### 4.1. When you need a subscription.

_When you need a paid license, and when you do not._

#### **1. Free use (personal or commercial).**

You may use the platform free of charge for both personal and commercial purposes, with access to the core features designated for free accounts. Some advanced functionalities, such as high-resolution satellite imagery, require registration.

Iterating Inc. reserves the right to request proof of eligibility for free use and may suspend or terminate accounts that fail to meet the stated requirements.

Free accounts do not include direct support from Iterating Inc. Users are solely responsible for issues arising from their own data or model inputs. Assistance is available only through the community, where users must make their project data publicly accessible in order to receive help. Iterating Inc. does not guarantee the availability, accuracy, or timeliness of any support provided through community channels.

#### **2. Professional or Team subscription**

A paid Professional or Team subscription is required to access advanced features of the Platform, including but not limited to scenario management, private data sharing with Iterating Inc., and professional technical support related to model development and Platform usage. These subscriptions are designed for large-scale or complex projects and for users who require direct assistance from the epanet-js team.

Iterating Inc. reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether a project or use case exceeds the scope of personal or educational eligibility and to require the upgrade to a Professional or Team subscription accordingly.

#### **3. Personal and Educational Accounts Accounts**

Personal and Educational Accounts are intended exclusively for non-commercial use. They are provided for experimentation, academic learning, research, and for exploring the functionality of the Platform’s advanced features. These accounts grant access to most Platform features, but do not include paid professional support.

These accounts may be used to test the capabilities of the service but must not be used for profit-generating or business-related projects.

Eligibility for a Personal Account is limited to individuals using the Platform for personal experimentation or research. Eligibility for an Educational Account is restricted to students, faculty, and staff of accredited educational institutions, and registration with an institutional email address may be required. Iterating Inc. may request proof of eligibility at any time and reserves the right to suspend or terminate accounts that fail to meet these requirements.

If at any point a user intends to use the Platform for commercial or large-scale professional purposes, including but not limited to projects on behalf of a for-profit organization, the user must upgrade to a Professional or Team subscription.

Users of Personal and Educational Accounts are not entitled to direct technical support from Iterating Inc. and may only seek assistance through the public community forum. To obtain help in this way, users must make their project data publicly accessible, as private project support is not available under these accounts. Iterating Inc. does not guarantee any response or resolution through community channels, which are provided on a voluntary and best-effort basis.
