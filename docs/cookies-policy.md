# Cookies Policy

## **INTRODUCTION**

Iterating Inc. (hereinafter, “Iterating” or “we”) owns the domain names “epanetjs.com”, “masteringwater.com” and “iterating.ca”, as well as the website we make available to our users (hereinafter, the “Website”).

We, in our capacity as data controllers, use cookies to enable traffic analysis, which allows us to manage and control the operation of our Website, as well as to improve the content and services we offer.

However, you can decide to give your consent to accept, adjust, or reject these cookies. Here we show you more information about our cookies. Please remember that obtaining your informed consent through a clear affirmative action will only be required for the use of cookies that need it.

For more information about the processing of your data, you can consult our Privacy Policy.

## **INFORMATION ABOUT COOKIES**

### **What is a cookie?**

“Cookies” are compressed text files that allow data specifically related to the device used when you visit a website to be saved. Cookies are just data; they are not software or script (code).

Cookies are essential for our Website to function. In general, they are useful for websites to adapt to user settings or preferences, and to store data about the visit or to save a Browse session. However, these are not their only purposes.

Cookies are NOT viruses. Cookies have a simple text format. They are not coded fragments, so they cannot be executed, much less do they run automatically.

### **Types and definition of cookies we use.**

We can define cookies based on criteria such as their ownership or who manages them, and their duration on the device. We can find the following types:

- **First-party cookies:** These are cookies sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain managed by the editor itself, and from which the service requested by the user is provided.
- **Third-party cookies:** These are cookies sent to the user's terminal equipment from a computer or domain that is not managed by the editor, but by another entity that processes data obtained through the cookies.
- **Session cookies:** These are designed to collect and store data while the user accesses a web page. They are usually used to store information that is only of interest for the provision of the service requested by the user on a single occasion (for example, a list of purchased products) and disappear at the end of the session.
- **Persistent cookies:** These are cookies where data remains stored on the terminal and can be accessed and processed for a period defined by the cookie's controller, which can range from a few minutes to several years.

In the tables in the following section, you will find a series of practical examples of cookies we use for better comprehension and understanding. In the table, you will find information about the ownership of the cookie explained above; those whose recipient is Iterating will be considered first-party, and the rest will correspond to third parties.

Likewise, there is another complementary classification with five types of cookies according to the purpose for which the obtained data are processed:

- **Technical cookies:** dedicated to the maintenance and operation of the website. These cookies are strictly necessary, as they are required for the use and access to the website. Specifically, they allow the user to navigate through a web page and use the different options or services that exist on it, such as identifying the session, controlling traffic and data communication, etc.
