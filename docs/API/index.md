# Overview

epanet-js contains two classes, Workspace & Project. A Workspace represents a virtual file system where you can store and read files that are consumed by the tool kit, such as [INP Files](http://wateranalytics.org/EPANET/_inp_file.html) or generated by it, such as [RPT files](http://wateranalytics.org/EPANET/_rpt_file.html) or [OUT files](http://wateranalytics.org/EPANET/_out_file.html).

A Project is a single instance of the EN_Project wrapper object and a singleton with all 122 toolkit methods attached. A [full list of all methods](https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/wiki/Project-Class#class-methods) can be found on the wiki. All method names have been converted to camelCase to keep with javascript convention.

Create a `Project` object by instancing the <a href="https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/wiki/Project-Class"><code>Project</code></a> class with a <a href="https://github.com/modelcreate/epanet-js/wiki/Workspace-Class"><code>Workspace</code></a> object.

```javascript
import { Project, Workspace } from `epanet-js`

const ws = new Workspace()
const model = new Project(ws)
```

If you are not familiar with the OWA-EPANET Toolkit API or EPANET it is worthwhile reading the [OWA-EPANET Toolkit API documentation](http://wateranalytics.org/EPANET/) and [OWA-EPANET wiki](https://github.com/openwateranalytics/epanet/wiki).
