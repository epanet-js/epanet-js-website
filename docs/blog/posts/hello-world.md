# Hello world!

EPANET is a powerful hydraulic analysis software that is widely used in the water distribution industry. It allows users to model and analyze the behavior of water distribution systems, including the flow of water through pipes, the pressure at various points in the system, and the consumption of water by customers.

EPANET has been an invaluable tool for engineers and water utilities for many years, but until recently, it was only available as a standalone desktop application. This meant that users had to install the software on their local machines in order to use it, and it was not possible to access the tool from a web browser.

<!-- more -->

To address this limitation, we have recently released epanet-js, which allows developers to build web applications using the epanet engine. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for using epanet in a variety of contexts, including in the development of online tools for water utilities, or as part of larger software systems that require hydraulic analysis capabilities.

One of the key benefits of epanet-js is that it allows users to access the power of epanet from any device with a web browser, without the need to install any software. This makes it much easier to share and collaborate on hydraulic analysis projects, and allows users to access the tool from anywhere, at any time.

In addition, epanet-js is fully open source, which means that developers are free to use, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit. This opens up even more opportunities for innovation and customization, and allows developers to build custom solutions that meet the specific needs of their users.

Overall, the release of epanet-js represents a major step forward for the water distribution industry, and we are excited to see what creative and innovative uses developers come up with for this powerful tool.
