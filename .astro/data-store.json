You will need to register and provide your email address to receive a serial code.\n\n**Download:** [Delphi Community Edition](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/starter/free-download)\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/compile-epanet-gui/2-register.png\" alt=\"Delphi Community Edition Download\" style=\"border:1px solid #e5e5e5;box-shadow: 0px 10px 20px -6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);\" />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Register to download Delphi Community Edition, and you will receive a serial code via email.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## Step 3: Install Delphi\n\nOnce you have downloaded the installer, run it and select “I already have a product serial number”. Enter the serial number sent to your email and proceed with the installation. When prompted for what to install, only select “Delphi Windows Community” and deselect anything else. Then, select “TeeChart Standard” from the additional options and press install.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/compile-epanet-gui/3-4-install.jpg\" alt=\"Delphi install screen 1\" />\n  \u003Cfigcaption>Install Delphi Windows Community Edition, and remember to select TeeChart Standard during the installation process.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## Step 4: Copy the toolkit DLL\n\nIn the GUI source code you downloaded, there will be a folder called Delphi_GUI which contains another folder called epanet2w.

It’s a great chance to connect with us directly, and we’d love to see you there.\n\nLet's dive into what's new.\n\n## **The Easiest Way to Model Water Demand**\n\nWe know one of the biggest challenges in building an accurate hydraulic model is allocating demands correctly. Traditionally, this has been a complex, time-consuming process often done outside of your main modeling tool. The best way to represent demand is to model it where it comes from: your individual customers.\n\nWe're excited to announce that we've made this process incredibly simple with our new **Customer Points** feature!\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=720 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-08/cust-import.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nYou can now import a GeoJSON file of your customers directly into epanet-js. Our new import wizard guides you through the process, automatically allocating each customer to the nearest pipe. Here’s how it makes your life easier:\n\n- **Intelligent Allocation:** The system uses a set of rules to connect customers to the right pipes. You can customize these rules, setting maximum pipe diameters and search distances to ensure customers are assigned logically (e.g., connect to smaller distribution mains before large transmission lines).\n- **Clear Demand Tracking:** When you select a junction, you'll see a new **Customer Demand** field showing the total demand from all connected customers. You can click this field to see a list of every individual customer allocated to that junction.\n- **Easy Manual Adjustments:** If a customer is assigned to the wrong pipe, you can easily **Reconnect** them.

We've completely redesigned the welcome screen to be cleaner, simpler, and more helpful. The old screen was functional but cluttered. The new design guides you with clear, logical actions:\n\n- **Getting Started:** A prominent button guides new users to the Quick Start Guide.\n- **Build and Develop:** Quickly create a new project or open an existing one.\n- **Explore the app:** Demo networks are clearly presented as a way to explore what epanet-js can do.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"position: relative; width: 700px;\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-08/welcome-after.png\" \n      width=\"700\" \n      loading=\"lazy\" \n      alt=\"Welcome screen after\"\n      style=\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; transition: opacity 0.5s ease; cursor: crosshair;\"\n    >\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-08/welcome-before.png\"\n      width=\"700\" \n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      alt=\"Welcome screen before\" \n      style=\"opacity: 0; transition: opacity 0.5s ease; cursor: crosshair;\"\n      onmouseover=\"this.style.opacity='1'; this.previousElementSibling.style.opacity='0';\"\n      onmouseout=\"this.style.opacity='0'; this.previousElementSibling.style.opacity='1';\"\n    >\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: -0.5rem\">Hover to see the previous version of the welcome screen.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThis new layout reduces friction and helps you get to work faster, whether you're a new user or a seasoned pro.\n\n### Start Your Project in the Right Place\n\nWe heard your feedback loud and clear: starting a new project and having to zoom out from a default location to find your own area was a pain. We've fixed this. When you create a new project, you can now **search for your location** in an autocomplete search box. The model will be created zoomed directly to the city, town, or area you're working in. No more needless panning and zooming just to get started!\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=720 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-08/search-location.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## **Making epanet-js More Global**\n\nOur international community continues to grow, and we've made some major strides in making the app more accessible to everyone.\n\n### ようこそ！Welcome, Japanese Speakers!\n\nWe are thrilled to add **Japanese** as our fourth community language! A huge thank you to Yusuke Shinoda for his incredible effort in translating and providing feedback to ensure the accuracy was top-notch.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-08/japanese.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: -0.5rem\">ようこそ！Welcome, Japanese Speakers!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Smarter Translations and Easier Access\n\nPreviously, community-translated languages had to be activated manually in the settings. We now have enough confidence in our translation quality to **enable community languages by default**. If your browser is set to French, Dutch, Japanese, or Portuguese, epanet-js will now load in your language automatically.\n\nThis was made possible by a major rewrite of our automated translation service. Building on last month's work, the new system is more robust, reliable, and scalable. It provides us with better notifications and allows us to add new languages much more quickly. Expect to see even more languages coming soon!\n\n## **Improvements and Bug Squashing**\n\n### Corrected Import Connectivity\n\nWe fixed a bug in the import process where assets with a specific ID format could cause junctions to be connected incorrectly. You can now safely use any ID format in your model build, and all connections will be made correctly.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cdiv style=\"position: relative; width: 700px;\">\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-08/import-bug-before.png\" \n      width=\"700\" \n      loading=\"lazy\" \n      alt=\"toolbar before\"\n      style=\"margin: 0; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; transition: opacity 0.5s ease; cursor: crosshair;\"\n    >\n    \u003Cimg \n      src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-08/import-bug-after.png\"\n      width=\"700\" \n      loading=\"lazy\"\n      alt=\"Toolbar after\" \n      style=\"margin: 0; opacity: 0; transition: opacity 0.5s ease; cursor: crosshair;\"\n      onmouseover=\"this.style.opacity='1'; this.previousElementSibling.style.opacity='0';\"\n      onmouseout=\"this.style.opacity='0'; this.previousElementSibling.style.opacity='1';\"\n    >\n  \u003C/div>\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: -0.5rem\">Hover to see the network after the bug fix.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## **Closing**\n\nThank you for your continued support and fantastic feedback.

While this feature is core to most commercial tools, it's been missing from the classic EPANET experience for years. We made it our number one priority to change that.\n\nNow, you can bring your GIS data directly into epanet-js. For consultants building a new model for a utility or engineers who have their data on hand, this feature is a must.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=720 autoplay loop muted playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-07/model-build-quick.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThe import process is designed to be fast and flexible:\n\n1. **Set Defaults:** Start by choosing your default flow units and headloss formula.\n2. **Import & Assign Layers:** Load your GIS files (both Shapefile and GeoJSON are supported!) and assign each layer to an EPANET element like pipes, tanks, or valves.\n3. **Map Attributes:** Tell epanet-js which data columns correspond to EPANET attributes like pipe diameters or element IDs.\n\nOur model builder then gets to work, intelligently connecting your network. It automatically handles connectivity for you—joining pipe ends to create junctions, connecting pipes at T-intersections, and splitting pipes to correctly insert point assets like pumps and valves. It even generates unique IDs and calculates junction elevations automatically.\n\nAs with everything in epanet-js, this process is built for speed. A moderate network of 10,000 pipes builds in under a second. We've even stress-tested networks of 200,000 pipes, which build in about ten seconds.\n\nAnd we're not stopping here. We have a few tricks up our sleeves to make this even faster, and we're already planning future additions to make the process smoother, like intelligently detecting the direction of assets (such as pumps and PRVs) and tools to help clean up messy GIS data.\n\nWhat used to take hours of manual (and less accurate) drawing can now be done before your coffee gets cold.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B9UWHMb3W4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-07/youtube-preview.png\" alt=\"Watch the new model build process\" />\n  \u003C/a>\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0.5rem\">Watch the full model build process on YouTube.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## More Realistic Models\n\n**Tanks and Check Valves are Here!**\n\nTo help you create more accurate models of your water systems, we’ve added two of the final major EPANET elements.\n\n### Tanks\n\nWhile epanet-js currently runs steady-state simulations where tanks behave like reservoirs with a fixed head, we know how important it is to represent your network as it truly exists. You can now add tanks to your model, set their initial, minimum, and maximum levels, and define their geometry. This makes your models more intuitive and ensures that when you export your .inp file, it's ready for any future analysis in other applications.\n\n### Check Valves\n\nSometimes referred to as non-return valves, check valves are simple but critical devices that ensure water flows in only one direction. This feature was essential for accurately modeling common scenarios like pump stations or pressure zone boundaries\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-07/cv-tanks.png\" loading=lazy />\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWith tanks and check valves now included, you have a complete toolkit for laying out your network.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center\">\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://app.epanetjs.com\" style=\"\n    display: inline-flex;\n    align-items: center;\n    gap: 0.5rem;\n    padding: 0.75rem 2rem;\n    font-size: 0.875rem;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    color: white;\n    zoom: 75%;\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #2563eb, #9333ea);\n    border-radius: 0.375rem;\n    text-decoration: none;\n  \">\n    Launch epanet-js now.\n    \u003Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\">\n      \u003Cpath d=\"M5 12h14\">\u003C/path>\n      \u003Cpath d=\"m12 5 7 7-7 7\">\u003C/path>\n    \u003C/svg>\n  \u003C/a>\n\u003C/div>\n\n## Speaking Your Language: Now in Dutch, Portuguese & French\n\nWhen we launched with English and Spanish, we were thrilled to see a global community embrace epanet-js from day one. However, this created a challenge: many of you were using your browser's built-in \"Translate Page\" feature, which we discovered was causing [a tricky bug](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41407169) that made simulations fail.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-07/epanet-js-languages.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: -1rem\">epanet-js in English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Dutch.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nTo ensure the app was stable, we had to disable the browser's in-built translation tool. But we were determined to find a better way to support our international users.\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-07/language-menu.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0;\" width=\"250\" />\n\nOur first step was to build a more robust foundation. Sam replaced our original home-grown translation library with i18next, a powerful and widely-used solution. With that in place, we began adding community languages based on where you, our users, are coming from. Portuguese was an easy first choice, as users from Brazil are our third-largest group. French was next, followed by a fantastic community contribution for Dutch.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"clear: both\">\u003C/div>\n\nBut as we celebrated supporting five languages, we realized we had traded one problem for another. Every new feature or text change required complex manual updates, creating a significant maintenance burden. To keep moving fast, we knew we had to innovate.\n\n### A Smarter, Automated Way to Translate\n\nThis challenge led to another major project this month: a fully automated translation system. We built a script that automatically runs every morning, checking for any new text added to epanet-js, and uses Google's Gemini AI to translate only the changes. It cleverly includes the surrounding source text for context, ensuring high-quality and consistent translations.\n\nThis system allows us to maintain many languages with minimal overhead. It means we can be more responsive, support even more of the community languages in the future, and make it easier for you to help!\n\nIf you are a native speaker and spot a translation that could be improved, we’d love your help. You can contribute directly via our [GitHub locales repository](https://github.com/epanet-js/epanet-js-locales).\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-07/translate-github.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: -0.5rem\">Community languages are now automatically translated used Google's Gemini AI.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nFinally, we’ve published [the script](https://github.com/epanet-js/epanet-js-locales/blob/main/translate.ts) and its automated process as open source! So if you’re using i18next or another internationalization library, you can also benefit from this work.\n\n## Improvements and Bug Squashing\n\nWe also made a number of smaller tweaks and fixes to make your workflow smoother.\n\n### Improved Junction Visibility\n\nA subtle but important change. We tweaked our automatic contrast logic so that junctions with light fill colors now have a more distinct outline, making them clearly visible even on light-colored satellite maps.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-07/node-stroke.gif\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: -0.5rem\">Watch the white junctions in the center to see the improved junction visibility.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### No More Accidental Moves\n\nWe fixed a frustrating bug where clicking just outside a junction could accidentally move it.

This is a great way to get a quick overview of where older pipes (which cause more friction and headloss) are located in your network.\n\n### Drawing Tiny Pipes\n\nPreviously, trying to draw very short pipes at low zoom levels could cause a crash. We've fixed this, so you can now model even the smallest connections without issue.\n\n## Closing\n\nThank you again for an amazing first month.

She brings deep experience and an incredible eye for detail, and as you'll see, she has already made a huge impact.\n\nSandra’s first project was building the entire Network Review feature from the ground up, a perfect example of her jumping straight in to tackle one of our users' biggest pain points. We’re so happy to have her on the team as we work together to build the next generation of open, accessible water modeling tools.\n\n## Introducing the Network Review\n\nThe Network Review panel is your new command center for quality assurance. It runs a series of checks to validate your network's topology and data, which is essential after importing GIS data. The goal is to find all the little issues that would normally cause a model to fail _before_ you ever hit \"run\".\n\nThe review is broken down into four powerful tools:\n\n### Orphan Assets\n\nThis check finds any asset (like a junction, valve, or tank) that is disconnected from any pipe. It lists them for you, and you can click on any asset in the list to instantly zoom to its location. From here you can either snap it to the nearest pipe, or delete it.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/03-orphan-assets.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Proximity Check\n\nThis tool is perfect for finding pipes that are close to each other but not actually connected. It works by scanning around each junction and identifying nearby pipes that could be potential connections. These gaps often happen when pipes are drawn in GIS but don’t fully meet — commonly known as overshoots or undershoots.\n\nClicking on a potential connection will zoom the map to that location so you can review it and snap the assets together if needed. You can adjust the search distance to find more candidates — we recommend starting with a small value and increasing it gradually until you stop discovering real missed connections.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=700 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/proximity-check.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Crossing Pipes\n\nThis finds any pipes that intersect each other without a junction. Depending on your network standards, you may want to add a junction to connect all four pipes.

These can happen for many reasons — a gap between pipes, a missing junction, or a deleted asset that leaves a branch floating on its own.\n\nDisconnected subnetworks are one of the most common sources of early simulation errors, especially when a model has been imported directly from GIS and the data hasn’t been fully cleaned up yet. By locating these issues early, you can quickly confirm whether the isolation is intentional (for example, a future development area or assets not yet in service) or if something needs to be reconnected.\n\nFor each disconnected area, the tool also checks whether it has a water supply source, such as a reservoir or tank. This helps you verify that every part of the network can be supplied — a key requirement for a successful simulation.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/06-connectivity-trace.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n## A Major UI and Workflow Refresh\n\nWe also revisited some core parts of the interface based on your feedback.\n\n### New Single and Multi-Asset Panel\n\nA common piece of feedback was that the asset panel was confusing. It was hard to tell which attributes were editable, which were read-only, and which were simulation results.\n\nWe’ve given the asset panel a major overhaul. The new layout clearly separates data into sections, and updated styling makes it obvious which attributes you can edit. We’ve also moved actions like _redraw_, _reverse_, and _delete_ directly into the panel so you don't have to hunt for them in the toolbar.''\n\nThe multi-select view is also much cleaner. Assets are now grouped by type (e.g., Junctions, Pipes), and these groups are collapsible, making it far easier to find what you're looking for.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/new-asset-panel.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">Before and after - the new asset panel!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### New Panel Toggle Buttons\n\nWe’ve updated how you open and close the panels in the app. Previously, you could drag the panel closed — but that left a tiny button to reopen it, which wasn’t always easy to spot.\n\nNow, with the addition of the Network Review panel on the left, we needed a more intuitive way to manage both sides of the interface. So we’ve introduced new toggle buttons on the toolbar that let you quickly open or collapse each panel. The icons also reflect whether a panel is currently visible or hidden, making it clearer what’s on or off at a glance.\n\nThis change gives you more control over your workspace and makes it much easier to keep the view clean while you focus on the map.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=700 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/panel-toggles.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center\">\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://app.epanetjs.com\" style=\"\n    display: inline-flex;\n    align-items: center;\n    gap: 0.5rem;\n    padding: 0.75rem 2rem;\n    font-size: 0.875rem;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    color: white;\n    zoom: 75%;\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #2563eb, #9333ea);\n    border-radius: 0.375rem;\n    text-decoration: none;\n  \">\n    Launch epanet-js.

Just select a new element (like a tank) from the toolbar and click directly onto an existing one (like a junction) to replace it.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/swap-asset.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Merge Nodes When Dragging\n\nYou can now clean up duplicate or misaligned nodes just by dragging one onto another. The nodes merge into a single junction, and all connected pipes come along with it. The tool also respects asset types — for example, if you drag a junction onto a tank or reservoir, the tank or reservoir stays in place and the pipes are correctly connected.\n\nThis makes it far easier to tidy GIS imports — especially when there’s a gap between major assets like tanks and the surrounding pipework.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=700 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/merge-nodes.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Snap to Vertex\n\nPreviously, if you snapped a new junction to the corner of a pipe, the pipe’s bend would remain in its original place rather than being replaced by the junction. So even though everything looked correct, the geometry still included that extra vertex.\n\nNow, when you snap to a vertex, the bend is removed and the junction becomes the new connection point. This results in cleaner geometry and pipes that move as you’d expect when adjusting the junction later.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/snap-to-vertex.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Performance Improvement with Selection\n\nWe re-engineered how asset selection works. This fixes a Mapbox bug that caused stuttering and frame drops when selecting a large number of assets, which was essential for the new Connectivity Trace tool and makes the whole app feel faster.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/selection-improvement.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">Before and after - a huge improvement in performance!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Ctrl-Draw Feedback\n\nWe added a small but helpful visual cue.

In the Map tab, you can now toggle the visibility of customer points on or off to keep things clear while you work.\n\nAnd as a quick tip — if you want to simplify the map further, you can hide road labels using the `T` icon next to the basemap layer.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=700 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/hide-cust-points.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Visualize Demand on the Map:\n\nBased on direct user feedback, you can now visualize demand directly on the map. In the Map tab, you can select 'Actual Demand' to color-code your junctions, making it easy to spot high-demand areas or verify your demand allocation at a glance.\n\n![Visualize actual demand](/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/actual-demand.png){ width=\"700\" }\n\n### Custom IDs for Customer Points\n\nWhen you import customer points, you can now map one of your data fields to be the asset's ID, rather than just getting a sequential number.\n\n![Customer IDs](/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-10/cust-ids.png){ width=\"700\" }\n\n### Manage Privacy Settings\n\nWe're committed to respecting your privacy.

The snap feedback now only appears when you've moved the asset far enough.\n- The `Ctrl+Click` shortcut was breaking redraw functionality — this has now been fixed.\n- Standardized the heights of modal pop-ups across the app for a more consistent feel.\n- Reworked the customer point importer to be more resilient. It no longer fails on null geometries and provides much clearer error messages.\n\n## Community and Growth\n\nIt’s been amazing to watch the community grow.

Check out the [recording of the session on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKPhihGw7AQ).\n- **Thank You for the Feedback!** We've been getting a ton of excellent ideas and feedback through our [roadmap](https://roadmap.epanetjs.com/). Please keep it coming—it directly helps us decide what to build next. In fact, a common suggestion was to make it easier to set attributes _before_ drawing, like default pipe diameters or roughness.

These gaps often happen when pipes are drawn in GIS but don’t fully meet — commonly known as overshoots or undershoots.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Clicking on a potential connection will zoom the map to that location so you can review it and snap the assets together if needed.

We’ve been working hard not only on new tools to make building and editing networks faster, but also on opening up the direction of the project itself.\n\nThis month, we introduced our [public roadmap](https://roadmap.epanetjs.com) — a place where anyone can see what’s coming next, share ideas, and help shape the future of epanet-js.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://roadmap.epanetjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/roadmap.png\" alt=\"epanet-js roadmap\" />\n  \u003C/a>\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">The new public roadmap is live — see what's coming next and help shape the future of epanet-js!\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nAlongside that, we hosted our first live webinar, rolled out new editing tools for reversing and redrawing pipes, improved the demo networks, and added new workflow features to make debugging and model cleanup even smoother.\n\n\u003Cdiv style=\"text-align: center\">\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://app.epanetjs.com\" style=\"\n    display: inline-flex;\n    align-items: center;\n    gap: 0.5rem;\n    padding: 0.75rem 2rem;\n    font-size: 0.875rem;\n    font-weight: 500;\n    color: white;\n    zoom: 75%;\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #2563eb, #9333ea);\n    border-radius: 0.375rem;\n    text-decoration: none;\n  \">\n    Launch epanet-js.

More importantly, you can now take part directly — vote on the features you’d like to see, comment on ideas, or suggest new ones entirely.\n\nWe believe _epanet-js_ should be a community-led project. By opening up the roadmap, we’re inviting everyone to help guide where we go next. Whether you’re an engineer, researcher, or utility manager, your input will directly influence the priorities of future releases.\n\nThe roadmap will automatically update as we move features from ideas into development, and you’ll receive updates on the items you follow. It’s a simple but powerful way to stay involved and help us build the tools you want to see.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/feedback.png\" alt=\"epanet-js feedback\" />\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">Vote, comment, and follow along — your feedback now helps shape every feature in epanet-js.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Watch the Webinar on YouTube\n\nLast week, we hosted our first community webinar, _Introducing epanet-js_, which brought together over a hundred people live and more than two hundred registrants in total. The response was incredible — thank you to everyone who joined us\\!\n\nIn the session, we talked about the state of hydraulic modeling today, why we built _epanet-js_, and how we’re building an open and sustainable future for the industry. We also gave a live demo of the app, shared what’s next on our roadmap, introduced the Teams plan, and finished with a long Q\\&A that covered everything from engine details to future features.\n\nIf you missed it, you can now [watch the full recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbbYdd4kWYE). The video includes bookmarks so you can jump straight to the sections or questions that interest you most.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"688\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tbbYdd4kWYE?si=M6EeYtvX-lLOlARX\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\n### Introducing the Teams Plan\n\nDuring the webinar, we also introduced the new **Teams plan** — designed for growing organizations that need flexibility and collaboration.\n\nTeams can now purchase floating licenses, pay by invoice, and receive volume discounts. The plan also includes priority support and access to additional features tailored for professional users.\n\nThis is a great option for utilities and consultancies looking to use _epanet-js_ across multiple users.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/teams-plan.png\" alt=\"epanet-js Teams plan\" />\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">Introducing the Teams plan — flexible licensing and collaboration for organizations using epanet-js.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Usage and Growth\n\nWe also shared some of our usage stats during the webinar, and the results have been amazing to see.\n\nThere was an initial big spike when we launched in July — which naturally settled — but since then, activity has continued to climb as we’ve added new features and refined the app.\n\nIn September, we reached **1,839 monthly active users**, up from **1,542 in August**. Weekly and daily active users are also growing steadily, showing that more people are not just trying the app, but continuing to use it regularly.\n\nWe’re incredibly proud of this growth for a free, open-source app still early in development, and we know it’s just the beginning.\n\n![epanet-js weekly active users](/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/DAU.png)\n![epanet-js weekly active users](/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/WAU.png)\n![epanet-js weekly active users](/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/MAU.png)\n\n## Features updates and improvements\n\n### Select Assets from the Report\n\nOne of the small but very useful additions this month is the ability to **select assets directly from the EPANET report**.\n\nWhen you click an item in the report, _epanet-js_ will automatically pan and zoom the map to that asset and select it.\n\nThis makes it much easier to debug issues, investigate results, or quickly understand what’s happening in your model — for example, locating where a pump turned on or a valve changed state during a simulation.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cvideo width=720 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-color: #e5e7eb;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  border-radius: .75rem;\n  border-width: 1px;\n  --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n  --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n  box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n  >\n    \u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/report.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  \u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Split Assets When Drawing\n\nEditing and extending networks just got easier.\n\nWhen drawing junctions on existing pipes, _epanet-js_ will now automatically split those pipes for you. The same behavior applies when creating new pipes, pumps, or valves, or even when dragging an existing asset like a junction onto a pipe — it will snap into place and split the pipe automatically.\n\nThis small change makes a big difference when cleaning up or building networks, saving time and reducing manual rework.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cvideo width=720 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-color: #e5e7eb;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  border-radius: .75rem;\n  border-width: 1px;\n  --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n  --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n  box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n  >\n    \u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/split-pipes.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  \u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Reverse Link Direction\n\nYou can now quickly reverse the direction of any link asset — including pipes, pumps, and valves — directly from the toolbar, context menu, or by pressing **R** on your keyboard.\n\nThis flips the upstream and downstream nodes instantly, letting you fix incorrect orientations or adjust the layout of your network in seconds.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cvideo width=720 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-color: #e5e7eb;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  border-radius: .75rem;\n  border-width: 1px;\n  --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n  --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n  box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n  >\n    \u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/reverse.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  \u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Redraw Pipes\n\nWe’ve added a new way to reshape and reroute pipes without losing any of their properties.\n\nWhen you select a link (pipe, pump, or valve), you can activate the **Redraw Tool** from the toolbar, context menu, or by pressing **E**. The tool lets you pick a new upstream node, place new vertices, and then select the downstream node to complete the redraw.\n\nYou’ll see the old alignment in light blue, so you can easily adjust the geometry while keeping the original attributes like diameter and roughness. Whether you’re fixing pipe geometry or connecting to a new part of the network, this tool keeps your data intact.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n  \u003Cvideo width=720 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n  box-sizing: border-box;\n  border-style: solid;\n  border-color: #e5e7eb;\n  overflow: hidden;\n  border-radius: .75rem;\n  border-width: 1px;\n  --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n  --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n  box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n  >\n    \u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-09/redraw.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n  \u003C/video>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Updated Demo Networks\n\nBoth of our demo networks — **Drumchapel** and **Waterdown** — have been updated to include **customer points**, giving everyone a chance to see how this feature works in action.\n\nIf you open _epanet-js_ for the first time, you’ll see these demos right on the splash screen, ready to explore.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\nWe fixed a small but important issue where the **Next** button in the Model Build wizard could disappear if your browser window wasn’t tall enough. You can now scroll and continue through the steps normally, even on smaller screens.\n\n## Community and Closing\n\n### Community Highlights\n\nOne of the most rewarding parts of this project is seeing how people all over the world are using _epanet-js_ and sharing it in their own work.\n\nThis month, we saw more posts, videos, and discussions from the community — and we’ll highlight a few of them here.\n\nWe're deeply grateful for everyone who takes the time to talk about _epanet-js_ publicly. It helps us reach new users and keep the conversation growing.

That unlocks a whole new category of workflows:\n\n- **Growth planning**: Enable new subdivisions as a city expands.\n- **Master planning**: Test future layouts or staged upgrades.\n- **Alternative infrastructure**: Compare tank locations or system expansions without rebuilding the model.\n- **Small-scale testing**: Quickly toggle pump options or pipe alignments to see how they perform.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=500 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-11/topology.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n      \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">Quickly enable or disable pipes and other assets to test layouts, upgrades, or scenarios on the fly.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWhile active topology is already useful on its own, it’s also the foundation for something much bigger: **Scenario Management**. This is the core engine that will support complex, multi-year planning, alternative design pathways, and advanced modeling workflows—all within a single model.\n\nActive topology moves epanet-js from simple simulations into true planning and scenario-based analysis.\n\n## **Three-point pump curves**\n\nDefining pumps just got a lot clearer. We’ve added support for **three-point curves**, letting you define shutoff, design, and max operating values directly.\n\nThis is the first step in bringing epanet-js closer to full EPANET standard support. We’ve already planned the next phase: full **user-defined pump curves**. While the three-point curve offers great flexibility now, we are working toward giving you complete control to include custom curves to model any pump.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=500 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-11/3-point-pumps.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n          \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">epanet-js now supports three-point pump curves, letting you define shutoff, design, and max operating values directly.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWe also improved the one-point curve view. Now, instead of just entering design head and flow, the panel calculates and displays the shutoff head and maximum operating flow, giving you a better sense of the pump’s full operating range right in the attributes panel.\n\n## **Polygonal selection tool**\n\nSelecting multiple assets is now much faster. We’ve added a new area selection tool that works exactly as you’d expect on a map:\n\n- **Draw a polygon** around the assets you want to select.\n- **Hold Shift** to add more areas (the polygon turns purple).\n- **Hold Alt** to remove areas (the polygon turns orange).\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-11/multi-select.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n          \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">Select multiple assets fast with the new polygon tool, with Shift to add and Alt to subtract.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nThis update is about more than just convenience; it’s a prerequisite for **Multi-Element Editing**. To edit many assets at once, you first need a fast, precise way to select them.\n\nThis is just the start of our new selection toolkit. We are planning to add **Upstream and Downstream Tracing** (selecting assets based on flow direction) and a **Boundary Select** tool, which will let you extend a selection out to user-defined hydraulic boundaries like closed valves or PRVs.\n\n## **New apps on the utilities site**\n\nWe’ve redesigned the epanet-js utilities website and launched three new standalone apps. These serve as proofs of concept—allowing us to get features into your hands quickly while we work on merging them into the core application.\n\n\u003Cfigure markdown=\"span\">\n  \u003Ca href=\"https://utils.epanetjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    \u003Cimg src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-11/utility-site.png\" alt=\"epanet-js roadmap\" />\n  \u003C/a>\n  \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">We’ve launched three new utilities apps—fire flow, data extraction, and logger optimization—now live on the site.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\n### Fire flow analysis\n\nYou can now run full **fire flow assessments** directly in your browser. The tool runs a rapid series of simulations—processing hundreds of nodes per second—to calculate three key checks:\n\n- **Available fire flow**: The maximum flow the network can supply at a location before pressure drops below your minimum limit.\n- **Needed fire flow**: If your required flow is lower than what’s available, this reports the actual residual pressure at that design flow.\n- **Designed fire flow**: The critical system-wide check that ensures pulling fire flow at one node doesn’t violate pressure or velocity constraints anywhere else in the network.\n\n\u003Cfigure>\n    \u003Cvideo width=600 autoplay muted loop playsinline style=\"\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    border-style: solid;\n    border-color: #e5e7eb;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    border-radius: .75rem;\n    border-width: 1px;\n    --tw-shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgb(0 0 0 / .1), 0 4px 6px -4px rgb(0 0 0 / .1);\n    --tw-shadow-colored: 0 10px 15px -3px var(--tw-shadow-color), 0 4px 6px -4px var(--tw-shadow-color);\n    box-shadow: var(--tw-ring-offset-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-ring-shadow, 0 0 #0000),var(--tw-shadow);\"\n    >\u003Csource src=\"/assets/blog/progress-report/2025-11/fire-flow-poc.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\u003C/video>\n          \u003Cfigcaption style=\"margin-top: 0rem\">A faster way to run fire flow: hundreds of simulations per second, all in your browser.\u003C/figcaption>\n\u003C/figure>\n\nWhile this lives on the utilities site for now, the plan is to bring this capability directly into epanet-js so it becomes a native part of your analysis workflow.\n\nWe also published a YouTube video that walks through the entire process and explains each type of fire flow in detail.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"688\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rx9JsUwjS3Y?si=q1X0Do2WpPhpQdk9\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen>\u003C/iframe>\n\n### Data extractor\n\nA simple but essential utility.

You can drop loggers onto the map to see their listening range instantly, giving you a clear visual of coverage and helping you test deployment ideas on the fly.\n\nFor more advanced analysis, the tool includes a **genetic algorithm** that searches thousands of combinations to find layouts that maximize coverage while minimizing cost.

We want to reimagine how scenarios work. Our goal is to build a system that is flexible enough to handle everything from quick, small-scale \"what if\" operational checks to massive, multi-year master plans. We want to break away from the rigid approaches set in stone by legacy software and give you a tool that adapts to how you need to solve problems.\n\nWe will soon be publishing a dedicated blog post detailing our plans for scenario management and how we expect it to work. We’d love your input on it.\n\nIn the meantime, thank you to everyone who has been sharing suggestions and feedback. Your input drives our roadmap and helps us focus on the features that matter most.
